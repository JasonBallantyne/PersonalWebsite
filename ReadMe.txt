d) "Describe how you have explored additional features of HTML and CSS." - Getting a solid homepage was the most difficult part of this. After getting a basic image and overlaying it with a title, the title was not clearly visable. Using w3schools, I learned about using a linear gradient in the background image and make the title stand out more. This worked perfectly. For the navigation bar, I used buttons following w3schools again for this, and used that on each of the pages. Various styling of the buttons was a lot of trial and error. w3schools was my main source for a lot of the information and is where I found information on tables also. While doing validity checks, there were some errors that needed correcting, and stackoverflow for these errors was also very useful. A combination of w3schools, stackoverflow, lecture notes and what we had already learned was used for this website.
